         * This allows us to shrink the number of solution by 50%. Such a boundary eliminates a possibility that a mirrored array can be generated in some other case (when i in for-loop has a larger value).
         * Of course the generated solutions (with such constraint) don't have to start with a smaller number and that is the reason why mirror() is applied to every generated array, i.e. solution.
         * In other words:
         * A pair of 2 digits (especially smaller like 1 or 2 in longer arrays) is inserted only if the first one is in the left "(roughly) half" of an array (depending on the digit of course).
         * If it is inserted in the right "half", these cases can be mirrored to the left "half" ones. I'm sorry if this explanation isn't explanatory at all :(.
         * If-Statement in the for-loop checks if a positions i and i+1+digit [number which will be inserted] in the array are free, i.e. there are zeros there, and if the index i+1+digit isn't out of bounds (thats why it's in the middle of these "ands" &&).
         * Then follows the reduction step, and the function solve() is getting called with array after insertion of a number "digit" and a number "digit-1". so that it "converges".
         * Then the positions, where the insertion has been proceeded, are again set free, i.e. their values are set to 0. This allows to produce a new (different) solution in the next iteration of the for-loop, i.e. for an another i.
